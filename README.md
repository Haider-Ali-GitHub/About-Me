Hi there, I'm Haider Ali! 👋

I'm a software development enthusiast who is passionate about creating innovative software applications that solve real-world problems. I'm fascinated by web design, computer programming, and the endless possibilities of technology. I'm always looking to learn new things, work on challenging projects, and collaborate with other developers.

🌱 Currently learning

Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in web development by learning React, Node.js, and Express.js to develop full-stack web applications. I'm also exploring different software development methodologies such as Agile and DevOps to improve my project management skills.

💼 Skills and Experience

Languages: Java, Python, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL

Frameworks and Tools: React, Angular, Vue.js, Node.js, Express.js, Spring, Git, AWS, Agile, DevOps

I've worked on various projects. Some of my notable projects include:

Conway Game of Life: An algorithm developed as an individual school project to imitate Conway's Game of Life. I implemented a hash-table data structure to efficiently store data and used display API for users to interact with object models visually.

Huffman Coding: A program developed as an individual school project to reduce file space consumption. I implemented a Huffman compression algorithm from the ground up, which effectively reduces saved file size up to 60% compared to the original size.

🤝 Collaboration

I'm always looking to collaborate on interesting projects with other developers. I believe that working together on a project can create better results than working alone. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or if you want to discuss any software development related topic.
